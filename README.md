   - Styling elements using CSS media queries for responsiveness.

2. **Hover & Focus States:**  
   - Implementing hover and focus effects to improve interactivity.

3. **Version Control with Git:**  
   - Using basic Git commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to manage and deploy the project efficiently.

### Continued Development

In the future, I plan to:

- Work on more advanced styling techniques to improve aesthetics.
- Optimize my CSS code for better performance and scalability.
- Explore JavaScript to add dynamic interactivity to similar projects.
